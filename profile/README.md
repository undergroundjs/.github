**UndergroundJS has been cancelled indefinitely.**

UndergroundJS was founded to highlight and level up our local community. By being community focused, our goal is to share different amazing projects, companies, and people in the Nashville community.

It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing that we will be cancelling UndergroundJS indefinitely.

We still highly believe in and support the Nashville community and hope that one day we can gather again to celebrate all the amazing things that are happening here.

UndergroundJS is a nonprofit event facilitated by TechFed Nashville, a Tennessee nonprofit organization whose mission is to support and grow the grassroots tech talent in Middle Tennessee through educational events and groups. TechFed provides financial stewardship, risk management and volunteer leadership development for Nashville-area technology events.
