UndergroundJS was founded to highlight and level up our local community. By being community focused, our goal is to share different amazing projects, companies, and people in the Nashville community.

After a successful inaugural event in 2019, UndergroundJS went on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are excited to return in 2023 with years of pent up excitement and energy.

UndergroundJS is a nonprofit event facilitated by TechFed Nashville, a Tennessee nonprofit organization whose mission is to support and grow the grassroots tech talent in Middle Tennessee through educational events and groups. TechFed provides financial stewardship, risk management and volunteer leadership development for Nashville-area technology events.

Join us as we celebrate our accomplishments and failures while inspiring and empowering our future.
